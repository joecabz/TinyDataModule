# TinyDataModule
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, R_analysis.R, does the following:
Download the dataset in the working directory.
Load the activity and feature information.
Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or sd.
Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merge columns with the dataset
Merge two datasets.
Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file tidydata.txt.
